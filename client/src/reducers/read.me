Reducers are pure functions that specify how application state should change in response to an action. 
Reducers respond with the new state, which is passed to our store and, in turn, our UI.

Flow:
1. Import all our actions from our types.js file
2. Define our initialState
3. Define how state should change based on actions with a switch statement
